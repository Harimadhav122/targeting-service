# delivery-service

    A delivery service is the microservice where an app/game is going to make a request. 
    Every request should contain the App ID, OS and Country information.
    Based on the rules in the targeting service, the delivery service will respond with a list of
    active campaigns to a particular user where the targeting rules are valid.
